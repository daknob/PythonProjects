Small Python Scripts to familiarize yourself with Python.

Here you can find several small Python scripts that can be considered small challenges. Written for educational purposes only.
Some code may be found obsolete or deprecated but it has been written so to make it easier to understand by the person I was
trying to teach Python at the moment. ;)
